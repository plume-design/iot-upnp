  * netifaces: Network interfaces discovery (to retrieve IPs)

They are tree important objects:

.. autoclass:: upnp.Announcer

    See :class:`upnp.UPnP.Announcer`

.. autoclass:: upnp.Device

    See :class:`upnp.Objects.Device`

.. autoclass:: upnp.Service

    See :class:`upnp.Objects.Service`

Goal
----

UPnP device have services that need to be announced. Services can be controlled
and work as SOAP api. The class Announcer is used to anounce a device which have
one or many services.

On UPnP references, a device can also have many embedded devices.

To make a UPnP device, you need to make a service, add this service to a device
and them, announce this device as a root device.
